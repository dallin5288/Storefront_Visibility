# Storefront Visibility Assessment Using Google Maps API
Overview
The goal of this project is to create a function that evaluates the visibility of a storefront from the street. Given the complex nature of visibility, factors like observer location, obstructions, seasonality, and direction must be considered. To achieve this, we leverage the Google Maps Street View Static API to capture street-level images of the storefront and assess visibility based on multiple angles.

Approach
Our approach involves the following steps:
Location Identification:
Collect the latitude and longitude of the storefront location.
Example Coordinates: 40.748817, -73.985428 (Empire State Building).
API Request for Street View Images:
We use the Google Maps Street View Static API to request images from different angles. The request URL follows this structure:

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=600x400&location=40.748817,-73.985428&heading=0&pitch=0&key=API_KEY


Parameters Explained:
size=600x400: Image resolution.
location=40.748817,-73.985428: Latitude and longitude of the storefront.
heading=0: Camera direction (0° = north).
pitch=0: Camera tilt (0° = level).
key=YOUR_API_KEY: API key for authentication.
We generate images from multiple angles (heading values of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) to simulate how the storefront appears from different viewpoints.

Image Processing and Visibility Scoring
After obtaining the images, we perform the following analyses:
Obstruction Detection:
Using computer vision (OpenCV or Google Cloud Vision API), we detect objects like trees, parked cars, or signs that might obstruct visibility.
Storefront Exposure:
We calculate how much of the storefront is visible compared to the total storefront area. This involves edge detection and contour analysis.
Angle-Based Scoring:
We average visibility scores across different angles to account for varying perspectives.
Seasonal Adjustment (Optional):
If historical Street View images are available, we adjust scores based on seasonal changes (e.g., trees with leaves in summer vs. bare in winter).
Visibility Score Formula:
Visibility Score=Visible Storefront AreaTotal Storefront Area×100\text{Visibility Score} = \frac{\text{Visible Storefront Area}}{\text{Total Storefront Area}} \times 100Visibility Score=Total Storefront AreaVisible Storefront Area​×100
Implementation
Here's an example of how we automate image retrieval and scoring using Python:
python
CopyEdit
import requests

# API Key and Location
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
location = "40.748817,-73.985428"  # Storefront coordinates
headings = [0, 90, 180, 270]  # Different angles

# Fetch images from different angles
for heading in headings:
    url = f"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=600x400&location={location}&heading={heading}&pitch=0&key={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(f"storefront_{heading}.jpg", "wb") as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print(f"Image captured for heading {heading}°.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve image for heading {heading}°. Status code: {response.status_code}")


Results
For each storefront, we:
Capture images from multiple angles.
Analyze visibility using image processing.
Assign a final Visibility Score between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating better visibility.
For example:
Angle (Heading °)
Obstruction Detected
Visibility Score (%)
0° (North)
No
85%
90° (East)
Partial (Tree)
70%
180° (South)
No
90%
270° (West)
Obstructed (Car)
60%
Final Score


76%


Conclusion
This approach provides a scalable method for commercial realtors to assess storefront visibility efficiently. The Google Maps Street View Static API combined with image processing offers a practical solution for evaluating how well a storefront can attract passersby from the street.
By integrating this into a real estate platform, realtors can make data-driven decisions when listing properties, enhancing their ability to market prime storefront locations effectively.
